{b}General Tips
{n:general}
All blocks in this mod (with a few exceptions like the Endergenic
Generator and blocks for which orientation doesn't matter) can
be rotated by using a wrench on them.

All blocks in this mod can be picked up by using a wrench while
sneaking. Most settings (like stored energy, possible inventory,
recipes and so on) will be remembered and restored when the block
is put back in the world.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Security
{n:security}
If you place down a block from RFTools you will automatically be
tagged as the owner. Being an owner does not prevent others from
mining the block but they will not be able to change ownership
(even after mining and placing it back). Using the Orphaning Card
you can clear ownership for your own blocks (unless you are an
admin, then you can do it all the time).

{ri:orphaningCardItem}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Only if you are the owner of a block can you change the security
settings of that block. Basically that means you can control
who can access the user interface. To change the security settings
of a block you have to right click it with a properly set up
Security Card:

{ri:securityCardItem}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Security Cards need to be configured in the Security Manager:
{rb:securityManagerBlock}

You insert the card you want to configure in the top-left slot
and then you can change the name of the channel, add players
to that channel and switch between blacklist or whitelist mode.

The security manager has a small secondary inventory where you
can keep your different security cards.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Once a security card is configured you can right select it on a block to
assign that block to this channel. You can only do that if you are the
owner of that block. The block will be linked to that security channel.
If you make changes to the security channel later (in the security
manager) these changes will automatically be reflected in all
linked blocks.

If somehow you lose a security card then you can make a new unlinked one
and right select the block for which you want to make a new card (only
the owner can do that).

If you want to make a copy of a security card you can place a fresh
card into the top right slot of the security manager.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Players cannot change the security channel on a block they don't
own. However, if you give them a security card that is already linked
to the same channel as the block then they can alter the security
settings for that channel in their own security manager. This
way you can give some users more privileges to allow adding and
removing others to a channel.

The owner of a block can always access the GUI regardless of the
security settings on that block. An admin can also access the
GUI in all cases.

Note that if you press 'shift' you can see the security settings
on a block in WAILA.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Smart Wrench
{n:smartwrench}
{ri:smartWrenchItem}
The Smart Wrench works as a normal wrench. However it has two modes:
'wrench' and 'select'. To switch modes just right click in the air.

In 'wrench' mode it will work as usual: right click with wrench to
rotate blocks (in most cases) and sneak right click to pick up a block.

'select' mode is used in combination with the Block Protector.
Sneak right click to select the protector and right click to select
blocks to protect.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}RF Network Monitor Item
{n:netmon}
{ri:networkMonitorItem}
With the RF Network Monitor you can select a block and it will try
to find all blocks that use or produce RF which are connected
(directly or inderectly) to the selected block. It will also show
you how much RF is in each of the blocks and the coordinate. You
can use this item to help debug RF related network problems.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Doubleclick on a line in the list of blocks will close the window and
the block will be highlighted for 5 seconds (configurable).

You can toggle the display between RF/tick or RF and you can also
filter the output.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Base Ingredients
{n:base}
{rb:machineFrame}
The machine frame is the base ingredient for most machines in this mod.
{rb:machineBase}
The machine base is the base ingredient for a few other machines.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Logic Gates
{n:logic}

{l:sequencer}Sequencer
{l:timer}Timer
{l:counter}Counter
{l:endermon}Ender Monitor
{l:redtrans}Redstone Transmitter
{l:redrec}Redstone Receiver
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Sequencer
{n:sequencer}
{rb:sequencerBlock}
The sequencer is an advanced redstone based sequencer. It is
capable of giving out a series of 64 different signals. You can
edit the pattern of these signals in the gui of this block.

The modes of this block are explained in the next page. You can
also set the speed at which the cycles are played. Default is 1
which means that the cycle will proceed every tick.
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
It has seven different modes:

    Once1: cycle once when pulse arrives. Ignore further pulses
    Once2: cycle once when pulse arrives. Restart on pulse
    Loop1: loop continuously, ignore redstone signal
    Loop2: loop continuously, restart on pulse
    Loop3: loop continuously while redstone signal is on. If
           signal is down, stay at current step.
    Loop4: loop continuously while redstone signal is on. If
           signal is down, restart.
    Step: step through the cycle one by one
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Timer
{n:timer}
{rb:timerBlock}
The timer is a simple gate that will repeatedly send a redstone pulse.
You can input any value for the delay so it can be used for very long
timeouts.

What is special about this timer is that it restart when it itself
receives a redstone pulse at its input. So given timely input pulses
this block will never output a pulse itself. By using this feature this
block can be used as a way to detect that a certain activity is overdue.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Counter
{n:counter}
{rb:counterBlock}
The counter is a simple block that will count redstone pulses and
emit a redstone signal when it reaches a certain amount. Then it
starts over. You can see in the GUI how many redstone pulses it
already got.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Ender Monitor
{n:endermon}
{rb:enderMonitorBlock}
The Ender Monitor only works in combination with the Endergenic
Generator. It will send a pulse based on three different conditions:

    Lost Pearl: send a redstone pulse when a pearl is lost
    Pearl Fired: send a pulse when a pearl is fired
    Pearl Arrived: send a pulse when a pearl arrives

Note that the redstone signal outputs on the red dot side and this
has to face away from the Endergenic Generator.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Redstone Transmitter
{n:redtrans}
{rb:redstoneTransmitterBlock}
This block will wirelessly send out a redstone signal on a
specific channel when it gets a redstone signal. Use this in
combination with the redstone receiver block. If you place this
block down it will create a channel. You can also link this
transmitter to existing channels by right clicking on another
transmitter or receiver.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Redstone Receiver
{n:redrec}
{rb:redstoneReceiverBlock}
This block will receive a redstone signal from a linked
redstone transmitter. To link this receiver with a transmitter
right-select the transmitter (or another linked receiver) with
this block.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}RF Monitor
{n:monitor}
{rb:rfMonitorBlock}
The RF Monitor is a block that you place in the world and that
can examine a nearby (3x3x3 area around the monitor) block and
gives a visual indication of how much RF is left in that block.
This block can also give out redstone signals in case the RF in
the monitored block is too low or too high. You can use this
redstone signal with the Power Relay (see below) to control
parts of your RF network.
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Liquid Monitor
{n:liqmonitor}
{rb:liquidMonitorBlock}
The Liquid Monitor is a block that works like the RF Monitor except
that it can examine the contents of a nearby liquid tank.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Storage Scanner
{n:stomon}
{rb:storageScannerBlock}
The Storage Scanner is a block that can scan the surrounding
area for inventories (chests, furnaces, other devices, basically
anything that can hold items) and show them in a list. You can
then select an inventory in that list and it will display the
contents of that inventory. Scanning the environment uses energy
and can take a while if you select a big radius. It also uses
RF to perform this scan.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
If you open the user interface of this scanner you get two lists.
The top list is initially empty but will be filled when you press
the 'Scan' button. It contains all the inventories (chests, furnaces
and so on) that it could find in the selected area. If you
previously scanned an area you don't have to do it again. If a line
shows 'REMOVED' that means the specific block was removed after
the scan.

If you select an inventory in the top list then the bottom list will
show the contents of that inventory.

Doubleclick on an inventory in the top list will close this
window and highlight it in the world for 5 seconds (by default).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
You can search for items in all inventories that it scanned. It will
mark all the inventories where it found an item that matches what
you typed with a yellow color. This gives you an easy way to find
out where you put that diamond pickaxe again.

The slider next to the 'Scan' button allows you to select the radius
that this machine will use to scan the area. A value of '4' means
that an area of 9x9x9 will be scanned. Note that this operation can
take a while.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Storage System
{n:storage}
{rb:modularStorageBlock}
The Modular Storage Block is an advanced chest. Before you can use it
you must insert a storage module. There are three tiers: 100, 200,
or 300 stacks. You can insert modules to make the chest work better
with various types of items. When you remove a storage module from a
Modular Storage Block the contents will be copied to the module.

The various item modules allow you to sort and group your items based
on various criteria. There is also a third slot where you can insert
a filter module to restrict items going into the storage.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{n:remotestor}
There is also a Remote Storage Block:
{rb:remoteStorageBlock}
With this block you can make a storage module available remotely.
You can put up to four storage modules in the remote storage block.
Then you can create Remote Storage Module items. These need
to be linked first to de right storage item. To do that place
the remote storage module in the appropriate slot next to the
item.

You can then use the remote storage module by combining it with a tablet
or you can insert the module in a modular chest block.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{n:storfilter}
Offline access with the Tablet:
{ri:storageModuleTabletItem}
With this item you can open the contents of a remote or normal
storage module from within your hotbar. To use it you need to
craft the tablet together with the storage module and you must
charge it with sufficient energy. Higher storage tiers will cost
more RF to open. To get the storage module and empty tablet
back you just put the tablet in your crafting grid.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Filtering items for your storage:
{ri:storageFilterItem}
With this item you can control what is allowed in the chest and
what not. You can whitelist or blacklist and also filter with
NBT, damage, ore dictionary or even based on mod.

This filter module is also usable in the crafter to control what
goes into the crafter buffer.

The storage filter item has its own GUI which you can only access
by having the filter in your hand (outside of the machine).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Automatic Crafter
{n:crafter}
{rb:crafterBlock1}
The Crafter is a powerful automatic crafting machine that can handle
up to eight different recipes in a single block. It can be used to
craft multiple items independent from each other or else it can be
used for more complicated multi-step crafting recipes. By default it
uses 100 RF for every crafting cycle (where it does all crafting
operations in one step).
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
The list at the top-left allows you to select all the supported
recipes. If you select a recipe you can edit it in the right grid
by dragging over the right items.

The crafter also has an internal inventory and four output slots
for crafting results. By inserting a storage filter item you can
also prevent unwanted items from being inserted into this inventory.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The 'Keep/All' button is only active when a recipe is selected and
allows you to control if this recipe will always keep at least a single
item in the internal inventory.

The 'Int/Ext' button is also only active when a recipe is selected
and allows you to control where the result of the crafting operation
of this recipe goes too. With 'Ext' (default) the result is put in
an output slot where it can be extracted by an external pipe.
With 'Int' the result goes in the internal inventory where it
can be used by other recipes in this crafter.

The crafter also has a redstone mode (button below which can be set
to 'ignore', 'off', or 'on') and it also has a speed mode which is set
to slow by default. Fast mode uses more energy.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Block Protector
{n:protect}
{rb:blockProtectorBlock}
With the block protector you can protect blocks from being harvested
or affected by explosions. Use the 'sneak-select' mode on the Smart
Wrench to select the protector and then just 'select' all blocks you
want to protect with the Smart Wrench in 'select' mode. The maximum
distance is 10. Note that the block protector will need a little
amount of power per tick for every block it protects.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
In addition it needs extra power when a protected block is being
harvested or affected by an explosion. If there is not enough power
to protect a block then the block is removed from the protection
list (and will probably get destroyed). If you want to make a room
to protect against more powerful explosions (like from the Wither)
it is recommended to use more then one block protector to protect
smaller groups of blocks. Also make sure to protect the block
protector itself.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}RF Power Relay
{n:prelay}
{rb:relayBlock}
The Power Relay allows you to control how much RF to output based on a
redstone signal. In its GUI you can set the amount of RF/tick to give
in case redstone signal is off and also in case redstone signal is on.
This can be configured per side. You can also mark sides as being
input-only. This is where you typically connect the power coming
from a capacitor or power generator. You can use this in block in
combination with the RF Monitor to turn off a portion of your RF network
in case power is low. For example, to turn off ore processing machines.
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Teleporting System
{n:telepo}
RFTools supports a teleportation system that uses RF to do the
transfer of matter. A teleporter is essentially one-directional and
consists of a transmitter and a receiver. So you need a pair for
two-way teleportation. To connect a transmitter and a receiver you
will also need a dialing device.

Energy cost of teleportation depends on the distance traveled. Also
travelling to another dimension is a lot more expensive.

If you're an admin and want to troubleshoot the portal network
you can use the Teleport Probe item (has no recipe). You can use
this item to check for problems with all receivers in the world.
Doubleclick on an item in the list will teleport you without using RF.
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Teleportation Blocks

{l:tptransmitter}Matter Transmitter
{l:tpreceiver}Matter Receiver
{l:tpdialer}Dialing Device
{l:tpdestcheck}Destination Analyzer
{l:tpbooster}Matter Booster
{l:tpaccess}Access Control
{l:porter}Charged Porter Item
{l:simdial}Simple Dialer
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Matter Transmitter
{n:tptransmitter}
{rb:matterTransmitterBlock}
The matter transmitter is placed on the ground and (when dialed to a
valid destination) will teleport a player that is standing on it. There
is a fixed energy cost which is consumed immediatelly when the player
stands on it. Then during the duration of the teleport (witch varies
depending on the traveled distance) power is also consumed. If there
is not sufficient power during the first power usage then teleportation
will simply not start. But if there is a power failure during transit
then potentially very bad things can happen to the player.
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Matter Receiver
{n:tpreceiver}
{rb:matterReceiverBlock}
The matter receiver is also placed on the ground. Players that teleport
to a receiver will appear on top of this block. Note that a receiver needs
energy. If the receiver doesn't have enough energy then teleportation will
go on but bad things will happen as soon as the player arrives at this
destination. So be careful!

If you give the matter receiver a name (using the GUI) then that name will
be shown in the dialing device which makes it easier to recognize.
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Dialing Device
{n:tpdialer}
{rb:dialingDeviceBlock}
The dialing device is an important block which is needed to connect
nearby matter transmitters to receivers anywhere in the world. It shows
a list of all transmitters in the vicinity (by default an area of 21x11x21).
It also shows a list of all receivers in the world. Note that a dialed
transmitter will consume a little bit of energy while it is holding its
connection.

The 'Check' button is disabled by default unless you have a destination
analyzer connected to this machine (see below).
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Destination Analyzer
{n:tpdestcheck}
{rb:destinationAnalyzerBlock}
This is a passive block that you can place next to a dialing device. It
enables the dialing device to check the status of a receiver or destination
dimension. This way you can be sure that a receiver and/or dimension has
enough power or is not blocked before attempting to make a connection.

You can also place a destination analyzer next to a transmitter. In
that case the transmitter will show a red colored teleportation beam
if there is something wrong on the receiving end. You can check the
actual problem in the dialing device.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Matter Booster
{n:tpbooster}
{rb:matterBoosterBlock}
This is another passive block that you can place next to a matter
transmitter. If this block is present it gives the transmitter the
capability to teleport the user to an unpowered receiver. This does
use more energy so if not enough energy is available in the transmitter
this will not work. Note that this block does not avoid all
negative effects. You will still get hurt slightly and you end
up rather confused. But it is still way better then dieing.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Access Control
{n:tpaccess}
Both the transmitter and the receiver can be set in public mode (default)
or private. In case the mode is private you have to insert a list of
players who can access this transmitter or receiver.

In case of a transmitter an unauthorized player will not be able to dial
to a receiver or to interrupt a dial and he/she will also not be able
to step through the teleporter.

In case of a receiver an unauthorized player can not dial to that
receiver but he/she can teleport to it if there is an authorized
transmitter already dialed to that receiver.
{-------------------------------------------------------------} 
{b}Charged Porter
{n:porter}
The Charged Porter is an item that you set to some target receiver (with
sneak-right click) and charge up. Right clicking the porter will teleport
you. Note that this requires more power compared to normal teleportation.
Also note that the receiver still needs power! To craft this use:

{ri:chargedPorterItem}

The advanced version that can store more power, teleports faster and
allows 4 destinations (sneak right click to add receiver and sneak right
click in the air to edit the four possible destinations).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Simple Dialer
{n:simdial}
The Simple Dialer is a logic block that will dial a pre-set
transmitter/receiver combination when it gets a redstone signal.
To set the transmitter and/or receiver you have to sneak-right
click with this block on the transmitter and/or the receiver.

{ri:simpleDialerBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Power Generator
{n:power}

Scientists working in The End have discovered an interesting property
of ender pearls. When a pearl is thrown in some controlled manner the
mystic properties that occur on arrival can be harnessed and converted
to RF. If done at exactly the right moment this can produce a lot of
power. A pearl thrown this way is called an 'Endergenic Pearl'.

In addition it appears that pearls 'remember' that they have been
captured this way. If a pearl is captured and then thrown again as soon
as possible its internal power capacity increases which can give big
benefits for producing RF from this. However, this means that the pearl
has to be fired again as soon as possible, as trying to restrain a pearl
from firing is very costly on energy.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note that even in optimal conditions it is possible that pearls are
lost. So a way has to be found to ensure that the system stays operational
at all times.

{b}Power Blocks

{l:powendergenic}Endergenic Generator
{l:powinjector}Pearl Injector
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Endergenic Generator
{n:powendergenic}
{rb:endergenicBlock}

The Endergenic Generator is the main block in the power generator system.
This device can capture endergenic pearls and fire them again. It has three
basic modes which are controlled by giving redstone pulses to this device:

    Idle: this is the default mode. It just waits
    Charging: in this mode the device can receive endergenic pearls
    Holding: in this mode the device is holding a pearl
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Charging mode is a 15-tick cycle. The most optimal time to capture a pearl
is at tick 10 (starting with tick 1). RF will also be generated if an
endergenic pearl arrives at any other point in the charging cycle but the
RF that can be generated will be a lot less.

When the charging cycle ends without a pearl being received then
the machine will go into idle mode again.

If a pearl is received then charging mode immediatelly ends and the machine
goes into holding mode. In this mode it will consume RF every tick. Be
careful holding the pearl for too long as you will then end up consuming
more RF then you gained. If the internal storage of the generator does not
have enough RF to hold the pearl then it will automatically be lost. Also
each tick there is a small chance that the pearl will be lost in any case.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
You can use a BuildCraft or Thermal Expansion compatible wrench to control
the destination of each generator. If you don't set a destination then pearls
will be automatically lost as soon as they are fired.

When selecting a generator with a wrench (right click) it will turn red
and then you can go to the destination generator (right click it again) to
set the destination. Pay attention to the message you get when you do this
as it tells you the distance (in ticks) between the two generators. This can
help you to time the rest of the system exactly right. Note that the maximum
distance is set to 4 ticks so keep that in mind.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
This mechanic of charging, holding and firing endergenic pearls at specific
times implies precise timing and cooperation of multiple Endergenic
Generators. You will need at least two generators to be able to produce
power although it will probably be hard to get optimal RF production using
only two generators.

If you have plenty of ender pearls and don't care too much about less then
optimal generation you can just throw in as many pearls as you want from
one generator and capture them in another. Then it that other generator
you just fire them away immediatelly without caring about a destination.
You will quickly consume lots of ender pearls this way so this might not
be the best way to proceed.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Pearl Injector
{n:powinjector}
{rb:pearlInjectorBlock}

This block has to be placed facing an Endergenic Generator or else
directly below it. This machine provides the only way to inject an ender
pearl into the power system. When it receives a redstone signal it will
convert the ender pearl to an endergenic pearl and immediatelly insert it
into the adjacent Endergenic Generator. If that generator was already
holding a pearl then nothing happens and the new pearl is lost.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Otherwise the endergenic pearl is immediatelly fired from the
generator and the system starts.

This injector has an internal buffer that can only store ender pearls.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Shield System
{n:shield}
RFTools implements a 'simple' shield system that can filter mobs, animals,
players, and items. You start by building the shape of your shield with
connected Shield Template Blocks of the same color. Then you put a Shield
Block next to one of these templates and you give it power.

A tier 1 shield can handle 256 blocks. Tier 2 ups this to 1024. The tier 3
ups this to 4096 and deals 4 times as much damage at twice the power.

To compose the shield right click the shield block with a wrench. The
shield block will compose the shield in the specified shape. If you hit
the shield with left click it will also connect on corners. Wrench the
shield again to get the template blocks back. By doing that you
can change the shape of your shield in case you're not happy with it.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To craft the Shield Template Blocks you use the following recipe:
{rb:shieldTemplateBlock}

Note that there are four different template blocks so you can use them
to make adjacent distinct shields. Every projector will only take one color.

To craft the Shield Block you use the following recipe:
{rb:shieldBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The shield has three visualization options:

    Invisible: the shield is totally invisible
    Shield: a transparent generic shield texture is used
    Solid: the shield takes the appearance of a given block
        (insert that block in the gui of the Shield Block)

In the gui you can also insert rules for different types of
entities. For every rule you have the following actions:

    Pass: entity can pass through
    Solid: entity is blocked
    Damage: entity gets damage
    SolDmg: entity is blocked and gets damage
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
You can also set the type of damage. By default the damage
will be 'generic' but you can also set it to 'player'. This
will consume more energy but you will get XP orbs as well
as loot that you normally only get when a mob is killed
by the player.

If you hit the shield projector with your left mouse instead of
the right mouse it will also scan on the corners for template
blocks. Additionally using the smart wrench it is possible
to add or remove shield templates to an already formed shield.
Note that doing this will not be remembered if you decompose
the shield again.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note that the shield also supports space cards. In that case you
don't have to use shield template blocks but instead you can
insert the appropriate space card to define the shape of
the shield.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Item Filter
{n:filter}
{rb:itemFilterBlock}
The Item Filter allows controlled input/output from any side of the
block. It has nine storage slots that can be configured to only hold
a specific type of item. For each of these storage slots you can
control from which side it can receive items and to which side
other machines can extract items.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Modular Screens
{n:screens}

If you want to display various things in your base then the
modular screen system in RFTools might be ideal for you. In
these screens you can insert up to 11 modules which can give
you various bits of information like energy in a machine,
the amount of fluids in a tank, the time of the day, simple text,
the amount of RF left in a dimension and so on. More modules
are planned for the future.

There are large, huge and transparent screen variations of the
screen. You can get those by using a wrench on the screen.
You can also color a screen by selecting it with a dye item.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Screens are not directly powered but get power from a Screen
Controller that you can craft as follows:
{rb:screenControllerBlock}

In the GUI of this block you can press 'Scan'. This will locate
all screens in a 65x33x65 area around the controller (or 129x33x129
for a maximum infused controller). From that point on these
screens will receive power from this controller.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
You can craft a screen as follows:
{rb:screenBlock}

A screen with no modules is just black. So to make things interesting you
should add one or more module.

Note that even with modules a screen will be black if it is
not getting power. Make sure you have a screen controller
nearby and press 'Scan' on that so that it finds all screens.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The following screen modules are currently supported:
    - Text: simple line of text
    - Clock: a digital clock showing the time of the day
    - Energy: monitor the RF energy level of a machine
    - Dimension: monitor the RF energy level of a dimension
    - Fluid: monitor the amount of fluids in a tank
    - Inventory: monitor up to 4 slots in an inventory
    - Counter: show the current value of a counter gate
    - Redstone: show yes/no text depending on wireless redstone
    - Machine Info: generic information on certain machines
    - Button: send out a wireless redstone signal (interactive)
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Some modules (like energy, fluid, inventory, and counter modules)
require that you first shift-right click on the machine/tank that
you want to monitor. After that insert them in the screen. The
maximum distance between the screen and the monitored block is 64.
The 'Plus' versions of the modules have no limits.

The Button module also allows the screen to be used in an
interactive manner. i.e. you can click on the screen and control
other machines that way.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Environmental Controller
{n:envctrl}
{rb:environmentalControllerBlock}

Using the environmental controller you can improve the area
around it in various ways. There are modules to give you saturation,
regeneration, and so on. Every module requires power so this doesn't
come free. A single controller can affect an cylindrical area
with a maximum radius of 100 from bottom to top of the world
(if you're prepared to consume that much power).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Spawner System
{n:spawner}
{rb:spawnerBlock}

With this block you can spawn many kinds of mobs. Using it requires
a bit of setup work though. First you need a full syringe for the
mob that you want to spawn. If you insert this syringe in the spawner
UI you can then see the other items you will need to spawn a creature
of this type.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To get the materials into the spawner you need to set up
at least one, preferably three or even more matter beamers:
{rb:matterBeamerBlock}

This block has a single slot for items. You can connect
it to a spawner by first selecting the beamer and then the
spawner with a wrench.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
If you then give the spawner and the beamers power they should start
to work. Note that to spawn a creature you need three types of
material. That's why it is recommended to use three beamers as
then you can dedicate every material to every laser.

The beamer needs a redstone signal before it starts.

Infusing the beamer greatly increases the speed with which it
can beam matter (and thus the spawning rate).

The leaf block in the spawner GUI indicates any type of living
material (meat, wheat, seeds, ...). Some types of living material
give a bigger bonus.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Builder
{n:builder}
{rb:builderBlock}
The Builder is one of the most versatile machine in RFTools. It can do:
    - Move a structure from one spot (even other dimension) to another
    - Rebuild a structure from one spot to another
    - Swap structures between two spots
    - Build geometrical shapes (dome, torus, box, ...)
    - Clear out areas in a certain shape (void blocks)
    - Quarry an area in a certain shape (silk touch, fortune, ...)
A chest on top or below is sometimes needed to supply or collect blocks.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Using the GUI you can control where the builder should place the blocks
(always at the back of the builder). This only works for space cards.

Other GUI options are:
{i:textures/gui/guielements.png,160,48,Silent mode: mute sounds from moving blocks}
{i:textures/gui/guielements.png,96,48,Support mode: create preview/support blocks}
Help to identify what will happen and help with gravity affected blocks.
{i:textures/gui/guielements.png,128,48,Entity mode: also move entities}
{i:textures/gui/guielements.png,192,48,Loop mode:}
In this mode the builder will keep running as long as it has a redstone
signal and keep on moving or copying if there is room to do so. If
this is off the builder will do one pass and stop.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
For moving, swapping and copying structures you need a space card
linked to a space chamber.

You can use Space Chamber blocks to mark the corners of the source
area that you want to work. One of these corners should be a
Space Chamber Controller block.
{rb:spaceChamberBlock}
{rb:spaceChamberControllerBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{n:chambercard}
{ri:spaceChamberCardItem}
Right selecting the controller block with a wrench will let it form the
chamber. If all is correct you will get a message saying so. Then you need
to use a Space Chamber Card (right click it on the controller) to link the
controller to the card.

Put that card in the builder, set the right mode and other
parameters and give it a redstone signal.

If you right click a linked space chamber card it will give you an overview
of all blocks and entities together with the cost of moving them.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
For building geometrical shapes, voiding and quarrying areas you
need shape cards:
{ri:shapeCardItem}

Right clicking such a card will open a GUI where you can set the shape as
well as the dimensions. A shape card can be upgraded in the crafting table
to make the void card and one of the quarry cards.

Note that several options in the GUI of the builder are unused if you use
shape cards.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Builder
{n:dimlet}

The dimension builder is explained in another book. You can
craft the dimension builder manual as follows:

{ri:rfToolsManualDimensionItem}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
